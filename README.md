This is a repo for the alx sprint 3 portfolio project. With this project,
I am/was at liberty to build anything of my liking, or complete the maze project.Having so many ideas on what I can build and as a software engeneer in the making, I choose a simple blog site. 
I choose this because I can use my website even after this project to not only demonstrate my abilities but to document my storiesabout coding and life in general since I am learning new things every day and because I want to spend the next few months or yearsto learn a lot of things in the coding industry. It would be a waste not tot document these things for fun, inspriration, reference and every oter reason you can think of


##BRIEF
This is a flask project. 
I will use bootstrap to implement the visual aesthetics because
	1. I know a little bit of bootsrap 
	2. Bootstrap is minimal, and will not take the spotlight away from flask, which I am currently starting to get
		confortable with
	3. Why not?
